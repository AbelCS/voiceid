== Differents among Speaker Recognition, Speech Recognition and so on? ==
  _Speaker diarization_: audio segmentation according to the different speaker's voices.
  
  _Gender recognition_: gender identification of a voice (male, female).

  _Speaker recognition_:
      * speaker verification: identity verification: is he Marcus? yes/no. Can be text dependent (by password) or text indipendent (regardless of what is saying).
      * speaker identification: name identification from a speakers database (who is speaking?)
  _Speech to text or speech recognition_: speech transcription 

== What is Voiceid? ==
  Voiceid is a library/system (written in Python) that identifies the various voices within the video (diarization) and associate them a name if present in the database (identification), according to the gender.

== Why Python and not Java?==
The core of Voiceid (LIUM SpkrDiarization lib) is written in Java, and at the beginning Voiceid was a set of shell scripts running LIUM tasks. We switch to Python when it become more complex. We are planning to switch to Java in order to simplify the access to LIUM routins and for better performances.

== Does Voiceid work in real time? ==
  No, it doesn't work in real time.
