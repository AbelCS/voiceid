== Differents among Speaker Recognition, Speech Recognition and so on? ==
_Speaker diarization_: audio segmentation according to the different speaker's voices.
  
_Gender recognition_: gender identification of a voice (male, female).

_Speaker recognition_:
    * speaker verification: identity verification: is he Marcus? yes/no. Can be text dependent (by password) or text indipendent (regardless of what is saying).
    * speaker identification: name identification from a speakers database (who is speaking?)
_Speech to text or speech recognition_: speech transcription 

== What is Voiceid? ==
Voiceid is a library/system (written in Python) that identifies the various voices within the video (diarization) and associate them a name if present in the database (identification), according to the gender.

== Why Python and not Java?==
The core of Voiceid ([http://lium3.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/doku.php/welcome LIUM_SpkrDiarization] lib) is written in Java, and at the beginning Voiceid was a set of shell scripts running LIUM tasks. We switch to Python when it become more complex. We are planning to switch to Java in order to simplify the access to LIUM routines and for better performances.

== What Voiceid takes in input? ==
Voiceid takes in input WAVE or video files that can be read by GStreamer. It convert the audio track with these specs "RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz".

== What Voiceid return in output? ==
The format of the output file can be: srt, json or [http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/ XMP]. Each of these contains the time intervals in which each speaker speaks into the video. Srt ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format SubRip]) is a file format used generally for the subtitles video.

== Does Voiceid work in real time? ==
No, it doesn't work in real time.

== Can Voiceid be used from a GUI interface?
Yes, there is a GUI interface named voiceidplayer that show all progress and result in a simple window.
