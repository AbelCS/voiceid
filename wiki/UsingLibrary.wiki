Using the library in Python scripts:
{{{
from voiceid import Voiceid, GMMVoiceDB

#create voice db 
#ensure the directory you choose have 3 subdir M, F, U
#you can make the dirs by typing in shell 'mkdir -p mydir/{M,F,U}'
db = GMMVoiceDB('mydir')

#add models to db: params the basename of 'myfile.wav' and the speaker, Giovanni
db.add_model('myfile', 'Giovanni')


#process a video/audio file containing various speakers
v = Voiceid(db, 'myfile.mp4')

#extract the speakers from file and search into db 
v.extract_speakers()

#print the clusters (one for every speaker) and relative speakers' names
for c in v.get_clusters():
    print v.get_cluster(c)
